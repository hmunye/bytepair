# bytepair

`Byte-Pair Encoding` (BPE) implementation from scratch, designed specifically for tokenization tasks 
in NLP and text processing.

> [!WARNING]
> Not suitable for production use.

This project is a minimal but functional byte-level BPE tokenizer written in Rust. It provides the 
core algorithm needed to perform subword segmentation, useful for tasks like language modeling and 
text encoding.
